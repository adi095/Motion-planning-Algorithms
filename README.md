# Task Planning Algorithms

This repository provides a comprehensive list and categorization of various motion planning algorithms used in robotics and autonomous systems. These algorithms are crucial for enabling robots to navigate, avoid obstacles, and reach their goals efficiently in different environments.

## üìã Categories of Task planning algorithms

The algorithms are organized into six main categories based on their core approach:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Graph-Based Planning Algorithms**
These algorithms rely on graph traversal techniques to find optimal paths in a structured environment.

- **RRT* Smart** ‚Äì A faster variant of RRT* with improved path optimization.
- **Anytime RRT*** ‚Äì Quickly finds a suboptimal path and refines it over time.
- **Closed-Loop RRT*** ‚Äì Incorporates feedback control for better trajectory execution.
- **Spline-RRT*** ‚Äì Uses splines for smoother paths.
- **Fast Marching Trees (FMT*)** ‚Äì Similar to RRT* but constructs a roadmap rather than a tree.
- **Batch Informed Trees (BIT*)** ‚Äì Combines features of RRT* and FMT* for efficient batch processing.
- **PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap Method)** ‚Äì Builds a roadmap by randomly sampling points in the environment.
- **Lazy PRM** ‚Äì Delays collision checking until necessary.
- **PRM-RRT** ‚Äì A hybrid method that combines PRM and RRT to handle both known and unknown areas.
